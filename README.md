# Home of the Nexus Protocol - Simplifying Storage for the masses

### Building for the decentralized web

Nexus Protocol is a Decentralized Storage Network (DSN) aggregator which helps developers build decentralized applications easily by abstracting the complexities of integrating different DSN's

Nexus provides a single point of access to all supported / major DSN via the SDK. We use AI to help individuals and businesses find the best DSN for their files, helping to make blockchain-based file storage more accessible and cost-effective. We aim to make decentralized file storage a viable alternative to regular cloud storage by reducing barriers to entry and improving efficiency.
